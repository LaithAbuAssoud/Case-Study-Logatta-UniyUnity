Uni Unity - Django Backend Development
Project Overview
Uni Unity is a social networking platform designed for university students, aiming to connect students, professors, university staff, and companies by creating faculty-specific groups.

My Role
As a Django Backend Developer, I collaborated in a team to develop the backend functionalities for several key features:

Login & Registration: Implemented user authentication for both login and registration functionalities, including user data management, secure password hashing, and session management.

Authentication: Built secure access control throughout the platform, defining user roles, permissions, and authorization checks for various actions.

Groups: Developed backend logic for creating, managing, and joining faculty-based groups, including group creation, membership management, and data access control within groups.

Polls: Implemented backend for creating, voting on, and displaying poll results, ensuring data integrity and vote security.

Live Chat: Set up real-time communication using WebSockets, handling chat messages, user connections, and real-time updates within groups.

Challenges Overcome
WebSocket Integration: Overcame the learning curve of WebSockets to enable real-time chat functionality within the platform.

Tight Deadlines: Met project deadlines through efficient teamwork, communication, and agile practices, including task breakdown, feature prioritization, and regular code reviews.

Lessons Learned
Importance of Documentation: Emphasized clear code documentation for future maintenance and team collaboration.

Learning New Technologies: Gained experience with WebSockets, highlighting the value of adapting to new technologies to enhance project capabilities.

Teamwork and Communication: Effective communication and collaboration were crucial for meeting deadlines and delivering a high-quality product.

Conclusion
This project provided valuable experience in building a comprehensive social networking platform backend using Django. The challenges encountered and lessons learned enhanced my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork approach.
