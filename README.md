# Case Study: Uni Unity - Django Backend Development

## Project Overview

Uni Unity is a social networking platform designed specifically for university students. It aims to connect students, professors, university staff, and interested companies by creating faculty-specific groups.

## My Role

As a Django Backend Developer, I collaborated in a team to develop the backend functionalities for several key features:

- **Login & Registration:** Implemented user authentication for both login and registration functionalities. This involved user data management, secure password hashing, and session management.
  
- **Authentication:** Building upon login and registration, I ensured secure access control throughout the platform. This included user roles, permissions, and authorization checks for various actions.
  
- **Groups:** One of the core functionalities, I developed the backend logic for creating, managing, and joining faculty-based groups. This involved handling group creation, membership management, and data access control within groups.
  
- **Polls:** This feature allows for interaction and feedback within groups. I implemented the backend for creating, voting on, and displaying poll results, ensuring data integrity and vote security.
  
- **Live Chat:** I played a key role in setting up the real-time communication system using WebSockets. This involved handling chat messages, user connections, and real-time updates within groups.

## Challenges Overcome

- **WebSocket Integration:** Being new to WebSockets, I had a steep learning curve. However, I actively researched and implemented the technology to enable real-time chat functionality.
  
- **Tight Deadlines:** Meeting the project's tight deadlines required efficient teamwork and communication. We adopted agile practices to break down tasks, prioritize features, and conduct regular code reviews to ensure quality within a fast-paced environment.
  
## Lessons Learned

- **Importance of Documentation:** While focusing on meeting deadlines, clear code documentation became crucial for future maintenance and team collaboration.
  
- **Learning New Technologies:** This project highlighted the importance of continuous learning. My experience with WebSockets demonstrates the value of adapting to new technologies to enhance project capabilities.
  
- **Teamwork and Communication:** Effective communication and collaboration within the team were essential for meeting deadlines and delivering a high-quality product.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable experience in building a comprehensive social networking platform backend using Django. The challenges encountered and lessons learned enhanced my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork approach.
